 Title
 Automate Data Extraction from Pro Kabaddi Standings**
 Open the Pro Kabaddi website using Selenium WebDriver (https://www.prokabaddi.com/)
 Navigate to the **Standings** section and locate the team **Jaipur Pink Panthers** in the points table.
 Identify and extract the following details for the team:
 * Matches Played
 * Won
* Lost
 * Score Difference (Diff)
 * Points
 Use appropriate locator strategies such as **XPath / CSS Selectors** to fetch the data dynamically from the table.
 Students should ensure that:
 * The browser opens successfully.
 * Navigation to the standings page is completed.
 * The correct team row (**Jaipur Pink Panthers**) is identified.
 * All required values are extracted correctly.
 ### Expected Outcome
 * The browser launches and opens the Pro Kabaddi website.
  * The Standings page is displayed.
 * The row corresponding to **Jaipur Pink Panthers** is located.
 * Matches Played, Won, Lost, Diff, and Points are successfully fetched.
 * The extracted values are printed in the console.
